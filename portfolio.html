<p>Beginning in February of 2022, I began to take an interest in low-level GPU programming, and subsequently the Vulkan GPU API. This project is a physically-based renderer that I wrote in Rust, using Vulkan, and with the following rendering features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physically-based shading (Combined Lambertian diffuse and Cook-Torrance specular BRDFs)</li>
<li>Bloom post-processing effect based on COD:AW slides</li>
<li>Directional lighting with cascaded shadow maps</li>
<li>Bindless resource management</li>
<li>Asset loading via glTF and optimized custom format</li>
<li>Atmosphere rendering with Rayleigh and Mie scattering (raymarched)</li>
<li>Simultaneous rendering of multiple frames</li>
</ul>

<p>After my initial brush with 3D graphics programming, I decided that I would try to make an entire VR game from scratch. The idea is that you would have a variety of gadgets that would modify your movement and would also serve a double purpose as weapons to help you stun and collect the main objects of the game, the Totoros that run around. This was very much a VR reimagining of <a>Ape Escape</a>.</p>
<p>The game is writting in Rust using the OpenGL API for 3D graphics with the following rendering features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gameplay interaction with AI agents</li>
<li>Custom collision and VR character controller implementation</li>
<li>Toon lighting from both directional and point light sources</li>
<li>HMD rendering and controller/headset tracking using OpenXR</li>
</ul>

<p>This was my first ever attempting at learning 3D graphics programming. It's just a bunch of instanced trees, grass billboards, a ground plane modified by a noise function, horrible shadow mapping, and a cubemap skybox. It also even integrates the OpenVR API for VR support. I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish while knowing so little.</p>
<p>The program was written in Rust with the OpenGL API</p>
