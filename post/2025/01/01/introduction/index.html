    <h2 id="start">Start</h2>
<p>First, Happy New Year!</p>
<p>After many years of reading and admiring the blogs of other game developers and graphics programmers, I decided to make it a resolution to maintain a blog of my own. I have been wanting to collect my thoughts in a centralized location, as well as build a platform with which I can make more of a name for myself. In this post, I&rsquo;ll introduce myself, then talk about my ideas for posts, and finally describe my graphics programming background.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I became enamored with virtual 3D worlds since the moment I laid eyes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtvrrdS_9kA&amp;pp=ygUUdG95IHN0b3J5IDIgbG9uZ3BsYXk%3D">a Playstation game</a> as a baby. The concept of being able to <em>control</em> what you were seeing really hooked me, and as I continued to play all the video games I could get my hands on, my appreciation for the art form grew wider and deeper, until I knew that I had to make a video game for myself.</p>
<p>I was ten or eleven years old when I started trying to use <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en">GameMaker</a> to make my masterpieces (I really wish I still had those old projects, but alas). I would try to show my friends and family, but never got much of a reaction. My folks weren&rsquo;t about to encourage me to spend my time on <a href="https://vgbees.com/video-games-are-toys/">toy-making</a>. As such, I gave up shortly thereafter. I felt that I was doing a really bad job, and I didn&rsquo;t have a foothold with which to learn more about how to <em>actually</em> make games. I felt stuck and occupied myself with other things for the next several years.</p>
<p>I was seventeen, and a senior in high-school, when I decided to teach myself Python so that I could write a Twitter bot. The experience showed me how much I loved programming and how much potential as a programmer I really had. I studied hard, and attended <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">OSU</a> where I majored in Computer Science, while also doing <a href="https://github.com/NickDriscoll?tab=repositories">many personal programming projects</a>, including some game attempts, on my own time. I got an internship at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battelle_Memorial_Institute">Battelle</a>, a very ethical nonprofit research institute. After graduating, I began my first full-time job as a DevOps engineer at a local FinTech company (I know, I know).</p>
<p>While working full-time, I taught myself how to write 3D graphics applications using OpenGL and Vulkan, and in February of 2024 I started a new job at LunarG, where I currently work on tools related to the Vulkan ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="post-ideas">Post Ideas</h2>
<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to blog about my experiences developing my own games and programs. I have implemented a few non-trivial things, and have heretofore felt like I&rsquo;ve already wasted opportunities to share my experiences. Well no longer!</p>
<p>Second, as someone who began his programming life in a self-taught manner and was later made very frustrated by dogmatic, object-oriented programming instructors, I have many strong opinions about the culture we have surrounding discussions of &ldquo;good&rdquo; code. <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">Casey Muratori&rsquo;s excellent article about code organization</a> really saved me back in the day, and forms a large part of the foundation that supports my current beliefs on what it means to write &ldquo;good&rdquo; code.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve also been inspired by frame breakdown articles such as <a href="https://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2020/12/29/graphics-studies-compilation/">these</a>, and as sucham planning to produce my own write-ups. I have already decided to tackle the renderers of Final Fantasy XIV and Monster Hunter Wilds (when it&rsquo;s released), but I&rsquo;ll also keep an open mind to any other games that come along.</p>
<p>That all said, this is where you can stop reading if you&rsquo;re not interested in my graphics programming life story. I hope you enjoy the upcoming year of posts!</p>
<h2 id="my-graphics-programming-life-story">My graphics programming life story</h2>
<p>I wasted many years believing that I needed a teacher in order to learn difficult concepts, so it was finally in the summer of 2019, after taking a terrible and useless graphics class in college, that I tried learning how to program 3D graphics in earnest. I knew that I had to get over my fear and pursue the knowledge I wanted through any means I could muster. That said, I began teaching myself OpenGL by reading the class textbook and <a href="https://learnopengl.com">learnopengl.com</a> so that I could write a small sample program I named <a href="https://github.com/NickDriscoll/model_viewer">model_viewer</a>. Because I just can&rsquo;t help myself, the program also integrated with SteamVR so that I could interact with the scene using my HTC Vive.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a demo I recorded of the program in February 2020:</p>
<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_sz0D57apQ?si=lNe8mmPHW_0y9jXQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Of course, a large part of my motivation to learn 3D graphics programming was to make my own game using custom technology, so not long after reaching satisfaction with model_viewer, I moved on to trying to make a full VR game using OpenGL and OpenXR, creatively named <a href="https://github.com/NickDriscoll/vr_game_prototype">vr_game_prototype</a>. It was basically supposed to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQDKLgH6W0&amp;pp=ygUKYXBlIGVzY2FwZQ%3D%3D">Ape Escape</a> but in VR, I thought the concept had juice. It came pretty far along, and I learned a ton and had many &ldquo;firsts&rdquo;, but eventually I lost interest in completing it due to becoming fed up with OpenGL&rsquo;s API design.</p>
<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HBJdzkKTQA?si=BxxmIOZQUn4qr2h_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>OpenGL&rsquo;s resource binding model felt too restrictive, so I wanted to learn one of the modern, lower-level APIs such as DirectX12 or Vulkan. Having always believed in open technology, and thinking that learning the hardest API made the most sense long-term, I started teaching myself Vulkan in February of 2022. The product of this work was a project I named <a href="https://github.com/NickDriscoll/vk_viewer">vk_viewer</a>. I implemented cascaded shadow maps correctly, as well as COD: Advanced Warfare style bloom, integrated an open-source physics engine, and more accolades you can check out by visiting the repo.</p>

<p>After the success of that project, I felt cofident enough to apply to be a speaker at <a href="https://www.thegdex.com/">GDEX</a> 2023 for their Developer Day that year, and got in! I gave a presentation where I walked through the triangle rasterization pipeline, and then explained what I thought would be the best way for a new graphics programmer to come to grips with the discipline, including what tools to use, books to read, and Discords to join.</p>

<p>It was a pretty low-key affair, but I really engaged with my audience in-person, as well as on YouTube where many <a href="https://youtu.be/b4iIg32g65s">YouTube commenters</a> have expressed their appreciation for the usefulness of my talk, which has meant a lot to me.</p>
<p>Regarding vk_viewer, I lost interest in the project after getting frustrated with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. After which, I started a C++ Vulkan renderer project in order to bolster my resume. Ironically, I sent my resume to LunarG only a few weeks after I started the project, but I suppose my interview and failed PR to Dolphin convinced them I knew enough C++ to be productive.</p>
<p>I have since started a new project, but it&rsquo;s still very much in its infancy.</p>
